## 🎯 Core Vision

**One-line pitch:**
> "The office simulation game that finally *gets* what it's actually like to work in a company — and lets you run one."

**Core fantasy (all four must coexist):**
- Be the CEO who builds an empire from nothing
- Watch your team's personalities and dynamics play out like a simulation
- Make strategic decisions that beat your competitors
- Design and grow your office space floor by floor

**Hidden educational goal:**
- Players learn how an NGO/corporate office actually operates
- Understand each role's challenges: Procurement, Operations, Secretary, Management
- Experience the donor-dependency model of NGO funding — no income generation, rely on donors and HQ annual funding
- Cross-team cooperation is required to succeed (no single team can win alone)

**The Kairosoft DNA we keep:**
- Pixel art aesthetic — charming, not realistic
- 30 Framerate
- Stats bars that go up as you improve
- Watch employees visually doing their jobs (idle animations, walking to rooms)
- Satisfying number growth loop
- Chill pace — player sets direction, game runs itself
- Facility combos reward spatial planning

**What makes Pocket Office different from Kairosoft:**
- Employees have complex, *relatable* personalities (office archetypes everyone recognizes)
- Train employees using Corporate Points earned from working
- Group training bonuses — certain personality/role combinations train better together
- Random events pulled directly from real office life
- Office politics and drama between employees — relationships that shift over time
- Work-life balance as a core mechanic (burnout, vacation, morale)
- 5-year structured campaign with annual evaluations + sandbox after ending
- **Fever Mode** — when Office Motivation hits 100%, all stats double for 5 minutes
- Task-Stat matching — specific stats make employees better at specific task types
- Donor system teaches NGO funding model — win donors via Research to unlock projects and new recruits

---

## 👥 Target Audience

| Segment | Why they play |
|---|---|
| Office workers (25–45) | Cathartic — finally *they* make the decisions |
| Kairosoft fans | Familiar loop, deeper employee layer |
| Casual simulation fans | Low commitment, chill, pick up and put down |

**Platform:** iOS + Android, portrait mode (390×844)
**Session length target:** 5–15 minutes per session
**Tone:** Warm, slightly satirical, never mean-spirited

---

## 💰 Monetization

**Model:** Premium one-time purchase — **$4.99**
- No ads
- Players pay once, get the full game; demo allows only 8 hours of play
- Rationale: office workers have disposable income and hate manipulative monetization
- Possible future: No upfront cost + paid DLC expansions (new company types, scenarios)

---

## 🏢 Company Type

**Single type for v1.0:** Corporate / Enterprise Office

This is the most universally relatable — everyone has worked in or knows someone in a large corporate environment. Future updates can add:
- NGO with agricultural field focus (similar to UN FAO model)

---

## 🕹️ Core Game Loop

```
Hire staff → Assign to projects → Earn Corporate Points + Revenue
     ↑                                           ↓
Upgrade office ←── Spend Corp Points ←── Win Donors → More Projects
```

**Daily loop (in-game time):**
1. Time advances automatically (chill — player doesn't need to watch every second but would love to anyway in case there is a pop-up)
2. Employees work on assigned projects; productivity determined by stats + office buffs
3. Employees walk around and use facilities (5–10 seconds per facility, then move on)
4. Random events fire occasionally — player makes a choice
5. Morale/burnout ticks in background for each employee

**Monthly loop:**
- Pay salaries + rent
- New project contracts arrive
- Review team performance

**Annual loop (KEY MECHANIC):**
- Year-end evaluation — scored across 5 categories (Revenue, Reputation, Team Motivation, Office Quality, Project Completion Rate)
- Compared against 3–5 AI competitor companies
- Year 5 = Final Evaluation = Campaign win condition

---

## 🏆 Win Condition & Game Structure

**Campaign mode (5 years):**
- Each year has an annual evaluation
- Year 5 final evaluation determines ranking vs. all competitors
- **Win = #1 ranked company after Year 5**
- Multiple outcomes possible based on strategy (revenue-focused vs reputation-focused vs employee-focused)
- After campaign ends → **Sandbox mode unlocks** (keep playing forever, no evaluation pressure)

**Prestige system (post-campaign):**
- After completing a campaign, player can "Prestige"
- Reset company but keep small permanent bonuses (e.g., legendary employee, +5% to all stats, extra starting cash)
- Encourages multiple playthroughs with different strategies

**Multiple playthrough variety:**
- Different random event seeds each run
- Random employee pool means different team dynamics every time
- Different competitor behaviors keep competition fresh

---

## 😤 Office Motivation & Fever Mode

**Office Motivation** is the collective energy/will of the entire office — renamed from "OfficeMorale" for clarity.

- Calculated as an aggregate of all individual employee morale scores
- Displayed as a 0–100% bar on the HUD
- Influences productivity, willingness to work, and performance across the board

**Fever Mode:**
- Triggers automatically when Office Motivation hits **100%**
- Duration: **5 minutes** (real time)
- Effect: **All stats doubled** for every employee
- Visual cue: Screen effect, music shift, excited animations
- After Fever Mode ends: Office Motivation drops to **50%**
- Rewards players who invest in morale-building facilities and events

---

## 💼 Corporate Points System

Corporate Points are the in-game resource equivalent of "Research Points" in Kairosoft games.

**How they are earned:**
- Employees completing tasks
- Employees finishing projects
- Employees using facilities

**How they are spent:**
- **Shop** — buy items to boost employee stats
- **Training** — level up employees
- **Research menu** — win Donors, unlock new capabilities
- **Advertisement** — boost company reputation

**Training details:**
- Assign an employee to a training session
- Different job types have unique training perks
- Certain groups training together earn **bonus stats** (e.g., Procurement + Operations training together = logistics synergy bonus)
- Training outcomes are influenced by employee personality and current stats

---

## 📊 Employee Stats & Task Matching

Each employee has a set of stats. Specific stats make them better suited to specific tasks.

**Example stats:**
| Stat | Description |
|---|---|
| Charm | Persuasion, client-facing tasks, donor acquisition |
| Focus | Deep work, report writing, research tasks |
| Energy | Overall stamina, sustaining long projects |
| Teamwork | Collaboration bonus, group project efficiency |
| Tech | IT, systems, technical project tasks |
| Operation | Admin, logistics, procurement tasks |

**Task-Stat matching examples:**
| Task | Primary Stat Required |
|---|---|
| Getting a Donor | Charm |
| Writing a Report | Focus |
| Procurement Run | Organization |
| System Setup | Technical |
| Team Workshop | Teamwork |

Employees with high matching stats complete tasks faster and with better quality output.

---

## 🎁 Shop — Consumable Items

Accessed via **HR → Items**. All items are **one-time use consumables**.

| Item | Effect | Stat Affected |
|---|---|---|
| Chocolate | Minimal energy boost | Energy |
| Ergonomic Chair | Minimal working stat boost | Productivity |
| Company Manual | Moderate focus boost | Focus |

*More items to be added in future updates. Specific stat values to be balanced during M4.*

---

## 🤝 Donor System

Donors are the NGO equivalent of "winning a new major client." They represent real funding and project opportunities.

**How it works:**
- Accessed via **Corporate → Research**
- Player spends **Corporate Points** to pursue a donor
- Winning a donor has **additional requirements** beyond Corp Points (e.g., minimum Reputation, specific employee stat thresholds, completed prerequisite projects)
- Successfully winning a donor unlocks:
  - New projects tied to that donor's focus area
  - New recruitable staff (specialists that come with the donor relationship)

**Design intent:**
- Teaches players that NGOs cannot generate their own income — they depend on external funding
- Forces cross-team cooperation (Charm for pitching, Organization for proposals, Technical for reporting back)
- Annual HQ funding also arrives as a separate passive income stream (no donor required)
- The Donor pipeline replaces the traditional "revenue from sales" model — players must plan for funding cycles

---

## 🏗️ Facility Combos

Facilities provide stat buffs to nearby employees. Placing specific facilities adjacent to each other activates **combo bonuses**.

**How combos work:**
- Shared resources can power multiple area effects simultaneously
- Example: A single **Coffee Machine** placed between a **Lazy Area** and a **Gossip Area** activates both area effects — the Coffee Machine gains the bonus of both combos
- Rewards thoughtful spatial planning without penalizing clever shared use

**Example combos:**
| Combo Name | Facilities Required | Bonus |
|---|---|---|
| Gossip Hub | Gossip Area + Cafeteria + Coffee Machine | Morale +5, Charm +3 |
| Focus Zone | Quiet Area + Company Library | Focus +8 |
| *(More combos to be designed during M3)* | | |

**Combo list** is accessible in-game via **Lists → Combo**.

## 👤 Employee System (Most Important Differentiator)

### Personality Archetypes
These should feel like people players have *actually worked with*:

| Personality | Behavior in-game | Office reference |
|---|---|---|
| Workaholic | High output, burns out fast, hates vacation events | "That guy who emails at midnight" |
| Gossip | Spreads morale buffs AND debuffs, causes drama events | "The office news channel" |
| Perfectionist | Slow but high quality, conflicts with Lazy types | "Won't submit until it's perfect" |
| Lazy | Low output, high morale drain if others notice | "Always in the kitchen" |
| Team Player | Boosts nearby employees' morale | "The glue of the team" |
| Lone Wolf | High personal output, terrible team synergy | "Brilliant but impossible to work with" |
| Brown-noser | Buffs reputation when investor/client events fire | "Always in the boss's office" |
| Quiet Quitter | Looks present, produces minimum output | "Doing the bare minimum since 2022" |
| Legendary | Well respected, built themselves from ground up, high start stats | "Been through all of the problems since 2020" |

### Employee Relationships (Office Politics)
- Employees develop **relationship scores** with each other over time
- Some personality combos create **drama events** (e.g., Gossip + Perfectionist = conflict)
- Some combos create **synergy bonuses** (e.g., Team Player + anyone = +morale)
- Seating/room placement affects relationship development

### Work-Life Balance Mechanic
- **Stress meter** (0–100) per employee — rises with overwork, falls with breaks
- **Burnout state** triggers at stress 90+ — employee becomes 20% productivity, spreads negativity
- **Vacation events** reduce stress across the team
- Player must balance pushing hard on deadline projects vs. protecting team wellbeing

---

## 🎲 Random Events (Must Feel Relatable)

**The classics (everyone has experienced these):**
- "The printer is broken 30 minutes before a deadline"
- "Mandatory fun team-building event scheduled during crunch"
- "New management wants to 'revolutionize' the workflow"
- "Someone left fish in the microwave"
- "Birthday cake in the kitchen — 30 min productivity loss for everyone"
- "The air conditioning broke. It is 35°C in the office."
- "One of the colleagues is wearing unbearable perfume."
- "Accidentally complained about a colleague in the group chat."

**Career/HR events:**
- "An employee got a competitor's offer — counter or let them go?"
- "Someone filed an HR complaint about [random coworker]"
- "New hire isn't working out — performance review time"
- "Employee wants to work from home permanently"

**Business events:**
- "Key client is unhappy with the project progress"
- "Investor wants a tour of the office"
- "Press wants to do a feature — but the office is a mess"
- "Competitor poached your best developer"

**Drama events (triggered by personality conflicts):**
- "Gossip spread rumors about [Perfectionist's] work quality"
- "Lone Wolf refused to attend the team meeting. Again."
- "Brown-noser gets credit for Workaholic's project"

---

## 🏗️ Office Grid System

- Grid-based office layout (10×5 tiles per floor)
- Multiple floors unlock as company grows
- Room types provide stat buffs to nearby employees:

| Room | Primary buff |
|---|---|
| Desk | Productivity |
| Meeting Room | Teamwork + project speed |
| Break Room | Morale recovery |
| Server Room | Tech project productivity |
| Training Room | Skill growth rate |
| HR Office | Morale + reduces drama events |

**Floor unlock tiers:**
- Floor 1: Startup (1–5 employees)
- Floor 2: SME (6–20 employees)
- Floor 3: Enterprise (21–50 employees)
- Floor 4: Global Corp (51+ employees)

---

| SME | 6–20 | $30K–$200K | 50–200 |
| Enterprise | 21–50 | $200K–$1M | 200–500 |
| Global Corp | 51+ | >$1M | 500+ |

---

## 🔧 Technical Context (for Claude)

**Engine:** Godot 4.5, GDScript
**Repo:** https://github.com/nicemidcontrol/PocketOffice
**Local path:** `C:\godot\PocketOffice2\godot\`

**Critical code rules:**
- No `class_name` except `Employee.gd` and `SaveSystem.gd`
- Use `load("res://FileName.gd").new()` — never `ClassName.new()`
- All variables need explicit types: `var x: int = 0` not `var x := someFunc()`
- `SaveSystem` must be listed before `GameManager` in Autoloads
- Claude Code cannot push to `main` directly — always create PR

**Autoloads registered:**
- `SaveSystem` → `res://SaveSystem.gd`
- `GameManager` → `res://GameManager.gd`

**Workflow:**
1. claude.ai/code → write/fix code → push to branch → create PR
2. GitHub → merge PR to main
3. Git Bash → `git pull origin main`
4. Godot → Reload + F5 test
